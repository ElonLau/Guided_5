# Guided Capstone 5

 In this project, you’ll launch your Spark job using a command line shell script in each workflow.
Learning Objectives: <br/>
By the end of this step, you’ll: <br/>
● Write shell script to submit Spark jobs <br/>
● Execute Spark jobs in Azure Elastic Clusters <br/>
● Design job status tracker <br/>

 Summary <br/><br/>
In this step, you practised a basic end-to-end operation on the pipeline you built. Shell scripts
are usually the most straightforward, reliable way to trigger a job. You implemented job status
tracking, which gives you the ability to monitor the progress of the daily job run, in order to make
sure that results are always delivered.
