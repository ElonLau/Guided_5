# Guided Capstone 5

- In this project, you’ll launch your Spark job using a command line shell script in each workflow.
Learning Objectives:
By the end of this step, you’ll:
● Write shell script to submit Spark jobs
● Execute Spark jobs in Azure Elastic Clusters
● Design job status tracker

- Summary
In this step, you practised a basic end-to-end operation on the pipeline you built. Shell scripts
are usually the most straightforward, reliable way to trigger a job. You implemented job status
tracking, which gives you the ability to monitor the progress of the daily job run, in order to make
sure that results are always delivered.
